Hi! My name is Harpaal Gohlwar and I am a student at Western Governors University currently pursuing my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, 
with an expected graduation date of December 2025. I'm currently working on multiple coding projects in my Bachelors program, and I have already 
uploaded some of them in my "Harpaal's Project" repository, along with a few personal projects! At this time, I am looking for software & data engineering
internships. If you are interested in contacting me, all of my information is listed below. Thank you so much for your interest!
